After of decade of trying to run more efficient Data Center it is time to tackle the elefphant in the room.

#Physical infrastructure from steel and concrete is a massive CO2 issue.

Facebook reports that 95% of its CO2 emissions come from Scope 3 (https://plana.earth/academy/what-are-scope-1-2-3-emissions/). So we started focussing on tackling the big issue, buy designing a modular Data Center that uses as little recources a possible, build completely out of wooden infrastructure.

We working closely with the Open Compute Foundation and partners like Submer (https://submer.com) to create the best data center with the smallest impact possible. If you like to participate, feel free reach out under:

Short spec:

Physical wooden Infrastructure 3990 mm x 3990 mm x 3990 mm Tier 3 ready F90 fire protection With DC Security doors Siemens DCIM with early smoke detection 100 KW total DC power for 2 Smartpods XL OCP Edition
